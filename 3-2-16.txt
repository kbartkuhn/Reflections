Reflections
Today we had lectures about internet as a whole.  We talked about the different providers and the different tiers of networks. 
We also discussed the best way to google things. I learned a lot about whole structure of the internet as a whole and that was 
pretty cool. The test did not go as well as I thought it was going to because I did not have a chance to study last night because 
the internet went out and I didn't have access to anything.  I tihkn the internet is fixed so I am going to go home tonight and look
over the things that were a little rough on the test so I am fully prepared for tomorrow.
