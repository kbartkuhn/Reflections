Reflection 3/1/16
Day 2 
Today we learned a lot.  We learned the basic building blocks of a website. I thought it was really cool to learn how to do it. 
I was suprised how simple the bare bones of website were, for some reason I always thought that there were more too it. 
I am kind of nervous for the exam tomorrow so I am going to go home tonight and study. I have learned a lot in the last two days and
excited to learn more in the weeks to come.
