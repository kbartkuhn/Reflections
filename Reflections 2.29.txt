Today we learned how to use the basic command terminal. There are very many different types of the command window but we used Git Bash. 
We learned how to pull and push documents within a group, which was pretty cool. We used the website github to share and download each
others repository. We learned a lot today and I'm actually suprised I understand it.

There were some guys who were really good at it and you could tell they were the very studious who did the Prework, which I wish 
I would have had more of a chance to get into but last week I worked about 65 hours so I didn't really have time.  I will delve into
the pre work more and more tonight since now I no longer hzve a job to worry about, which is strangely freeing in a way. I don't have 
to worry about shifts, or getting there on time, all i focus is on this and my future which is pretty exciting.
