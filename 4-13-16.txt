Today was an alright day, I've been sick with a stomach flu the last couple 
days so I was glued to the porclien. So I have been trying to play catch up and 
while I'm extremely tired so its not the easiest thing to do. I hope I can get
some good sleep tonight and come back tomorrow and be bright eyed and bushy tailed to 
try and catch up on what i missed.
